Scala CLI allows you to package your application into a lightweight JAR file, that can be easily run.
It only contains the byte code of your sources, and automatically downloads its dependencies on its first run.

The following snippet contains a short application to detect the OS:
```scala title=DetectOsApp.scala
object DetectOSApp extends App  {
    def getOperatingSystem(): String = {
        val os: String = System.getProperty("os.name")
        os
    }
    println(s"os: ${getOperatingSystem()}")
}
```

### Default format (lightweight launcher)

By default, the `package` sub-command generates a lightweight JAR.

```bash
scala-cli package DetectOsApp.scala
```

<!-- Expected:
Wrote DetectOsApp, run it with
  ./DetectOsApp
-->

Lightweight JARs require the `java` command to be available, and access to internet if dependencies need to be downloaded.

```bash
# Run DetectOsApp on MacOs 
./DetectOsApp
# os: Mac OS X
```

In the previous example, a Lightweight JAR that was built in a MacOs environment could also run on Linux.

```bash
# Run DetectOsApp on Linux 
./DetectOsApp
# os: Linux
``` 

ScalaCli supports building a Lightweight JARs in MacOS / Linux / Windows environments.
Only Jars built on MacOs / Linux are easily portable between this system. The Lightweight JARs built on Windows can only be run on this system.


### Assemblies
Passing `--assembly` to the `package` sub-command generates so-called "assemblies" or "fat JARs". 

```bash
scala-cli package --assembly DetectOsApp.scala
```

Assemblies also require the `java` command to be available in the `PATH`. As all dependencies are packaged into the assembly, nothing gets downloaded upon the first run and no internet access is required.

```bash
# Run DetectOsApp on MacOs 
./DetectOsApp
# os: Mac OS X
```

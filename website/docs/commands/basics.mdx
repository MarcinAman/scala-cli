import {RunnableCommand} from "../../src/components/RunnableCommand";

Scala CLI is a command line tool that executes a given command on the inputs it’s provided with a given [configuration](../guides/configuration.md) to produce a result.

The most important commands are:

  - [compile](./compile.mdx) compiles your code (excluding tests)
  - [run](./run.mdx) runs your code using the provided arguments (it’s also used when no other command is provided)
  - [test](./test.mdx) compiles and runs the tests defined in your code
  - [package](./package.mdx) packages your code into a jar or other format
  - [repl](./repl.mdx) / [console](./repl.mdx) runs the interactive Scala shell
  - [fmt](./fmt.md) formats your code

When Scala CLI is run without any commands, it defaults to the `run` command, so <br/>`scala-cli a.scala` runs your `a.scala` file.

## Input formats

The `scala-cli` CLI commands accept input in a number of ways, most notably:

- as source files
- as one or several directories that contain source files
- as URLs, pointing to sources
- by processing source code via piping or process substitution

Note that all of these input formats can used alongside each other.

## Source files

Scala CLI accepts the following types of source code:

- `.scala` files, containing Scala code
- `.sc` files, containing Scala scripts (see more in [Scripts guide](../guides/scripts.mdx))
- `.java` files, containing Java code

This example shows the simplest input format.
First, create a source file:

```scala title=Hello.scala
object Hello {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
    println("Hello from Scala")
}
```

The run it by passing it to `scala-cli`:

<RunnableCommand
    command={"scala-cli Hello.scala"}
    output={"Hello from Scala"}
/>

You can also split your code into multiple files:

```scala title=Messages.scala
object Messages {
  def hello = "Hello from Scala"
}
```

```scala title=Hello.scala
object Hello {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
    println(Messages.hello)
}
```

and the run them with `scala-cli`:

<RunnableCommand
    command={"scala-cli Hello.scala Messages.scala"}
    output={"Hello from Scala"}
/>

:::note
Scala CLI compiles only the provided inputs.
For example, if we provide only one of the files above:

```bash fail
scala-cli Hello.scala
```

compilation will fail. `scala-cli` compiles only the files it’s given.
:::

While this is *very* convenient for projects with just a few files, passing many files this way can be cumbersome and error-prone.
For larger projects, directories can help.


## Directories

`scala-cli` accepts whole directories as input.

This is convenient when you have many `.scala` files, and passing them all one-by-one on the command line isn't practical:

```scala title=my-app/Messages.scala
object Messages {
  def hello = "Hello from Scala"
}
```

```scala title=my-app/Hello.scala
object Hello {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
    println(Messages.hello)
}
```

For this case, run all the source code files in `my-app` by supplying the directory name:

<RunnableCommand
    command={"scala-cli my-app"}
    output={"Hello from Scala"}
/>

In our experience, `scala-cli .` is the most used command; it compiles and runs all sources in the current directory.

:::note
Scala CLI process all files within the specified directories and all of its subdirectories.

Scala CLI ignores all subdirectories that start with `.` like `.scala` or `.vscode`.
Such directories needs to be explicitly provided as inputs.
:::

## URLs

:::warning
Running unverified code from the internet can be very handy for *trusted* sources, but it can also be really dangerous, since Scala CLI does not provide any sandboxing at this moment.

Make sure that you trust the code that you are about to run.
:::

`scala-cli` accepts input via URLs pointing at `.scala` files.
It downloads their content, and runs them:

<RunnableCommand
    command={`scala-cli https://gist.github.com/alexarchambault/f972d941bc4a502d70267cfbbc4d6343/raw/2691c01984c9249936a625a42e29a822a357b0f6/Test.scala`}
    output={"Hello from Scala GitHub Gist"}
/>

### GitHub Gist

`scala-cli` accepts input via Github Gist’s urls.
It downloads the gist zip archive and runs it:

<RunnableCommand
    command={`scala-cli https://gist.github.com/alexarchambault/7b4ec20c4033690dd750ffd601e540ec`}
    output={"Hello"}
/>

## Piping

You can also pipe Scala code to `scala-cli` for execution:

<RunnableCommand
    command={`echo 'println("Hello")' | scala-cli -`}
    output={"Hello"}
/>

## Process substitution

Lastly, `scala-cli` also accepts input via shell process substitution:

<RunnableCommand
    command={`scala-cli <(echo 'println("Hello")')`}
    output={"Hello"}
/>

<!-- Expected:
Hello
-->
